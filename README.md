FortunaISK is a monthly lottery module for [Alliance Auth](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth). Its goal is to streamline ticket purchases, automate payment verification, and provide a user-friendly interface to track winners and lottery history. However, as FortunaISK is still a work in progress, some features remain incomplete or are subject to change.

## Features (Under Development)

- **Configurable Ticket Price & Reference**\
  Define a custom ISK ticket price and assign unique lottery references.
- **Automated Payment Verification**\
  Integrates with `allianceauth-corp-tools` (in progress) to monitor wallet transactions and validate ticket purchases.
- **Winners History**\
  Upcoming UI component to display past winners, their prize amounts, and other relevant details.

## Future Plans

Additional features, comprehensive documentation, and usage instructions will become available once FortunaISK is closer to a stable release.
